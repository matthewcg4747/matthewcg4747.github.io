<p>Hello! My name is Matthew and I am in the midst of a fellowship in 
Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. If there had to be anything you need to know about me it is
that I find myself consistently scattered and fractured. And this is not necessarily negative. At 
least for me, it isn't. I'm hoping this website will allow me an opportunity to compartmentalize my
thoughts and feelings, a "tangible" outlet for me to express myself to the universe. You might see me post a recap 
of an interesting week, an essay about a burning concept/idea that has been sitting with me, photographs that speak to me, etc
etc. More than anything I'm hoping to give those transient thoughts I often find myself mourning a space to exist and thrive. Please enjoy!!</p>
