<p>Hello! My name is Matthew and I am currently amid a fellowship in 
Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. If there is anything that you have to know about me it's
that I find myself consistently scattered and fractured. And this is not necessarily negative. At 
least for me, it isn't. I'm hoping this website will provide me the opportunity to compartmentalize my
thoughts and feelings, a kind of "tangible" outlet for me to express myself to the world if you may. You might see me post a recap 
of an interesting week, an essay about a burning concept/idea that's been sitting with me, photographs that speak to me, etc
etc. More than anything I'm hoping to give those transient thoughts that I often find myself mourning a space to exist and thrive. Please enjoy!!</p>
