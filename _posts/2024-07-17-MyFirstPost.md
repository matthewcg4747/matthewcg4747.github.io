Hello and Welcome! As you know my name is Matthew and I have been flirting with the idea of having a formal blog to get all my ideas out there. I know I have been dragging my feet on this for a while, but it is finally here and I'm excited to finally "publish" a few of the ideas that have been rattling around in my head. Who knows, I might even expand the website to feature my portfolio, upload projects of mine, or just generally experiment in new ways!

This website will start with my blog and I have a few ideas in mind. As I take this next step into my life abroad living in Ulaanbaatar I'm certain that there will be many new insights and experiences I'd like to platform on this site and share for you all to experience with me. I'm also interested in giving space to share the connections and points of intrigue I often lost track of. For instance, I've always been so fascinated by the (perceived) resemblance of basketball (the NBA) and KPOP. One essay I have in mind is to compare Twice and the NBA Dunk Context discussing what to do when presented with a saturated art form.

More than anything I'm excited for this expression of myself to take its own shape as I navigate the ebbs and flows of self-expression and documentation. I'm filled with so many questions, how might I grow in change, what will it be like to archive my experiences formally, how will my close ones interact with this new side(?) of me? This is something only time will tell.

Here's to hoping I follow through and by six months time I have a bevy of posts to look back and reflect on. I didn't really have a plan with this one, I mostly just wanted to get a test post out. Cheers!
